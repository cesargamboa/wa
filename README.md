## The problem

Whenever you want to send a WhatsApp message to something you don't have in your contacts list,
the first step is to add him to your contacts, then open WhatsApp and wait for the contacts list
to refresh, search the user and write the message.

## This solution

with a new chat to any number you provide and optionally with a text.
